## Practice with dicts

"""You're going to write a mini-database of favorite foods. Think of 5 people you
know and a food they like, e.g. "Naomi" and "brussels sprouts". In the file
fooddatabase.py, write a program that prompts the user for a name and prints out
that person's favorite food, e.g.

    What person do you want to know about? Naomi
    Naomi's favorite food is: brussels sprouts

Use a dictionary to store the association between people and
food. See:
[the dictionary docs](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
if you need a refresher on dictionaries.

For now, don't worry about what happens when your dictionary doesn't
have somebody's name in it. It's fine to have your program throw an
exception. Although, if you're interested in how you would handle
this, check out
[try statements](http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#try)

theFoodlist = [maur:peanut butter]

print "maur"

theList = [23, 4, -3, 19, 29]
print "Unsorted list:", theList
theList.sort()
print "Sorted:", theList
